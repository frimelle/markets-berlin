# Markets of Berlin

This is a website to get an overview on the regular markets in Berlin. 

## Dataset

We used the <a href="http://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/wochen-und-tr%C3%B6delm%C3%A4rkte">open data published by the city Berlin on weekly markets and fleamarkets</a>. You can find our version of the data in data/berlin-markets.json. We had to edit the data to make it work with our program and convert it from CSV to json. It is now structured and constistent.
